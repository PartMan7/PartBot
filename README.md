# PartBot

_A modern rewrite of PartBot for Pok√©mon Showdown._

---

Hiya! This is an ongoing effort to rewrite [PartBot](https://github.com/PartMan7/PartProfessor) from the bottom-up, with better practices than the steaming pile of bamboo sticks that currently supports it.

This might take a while...

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PartMan7/PartBot.git
   cd PartBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**

   Modify the `.env` file (which is automatically copied from `.env.example`).

4. **Start the bot**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
